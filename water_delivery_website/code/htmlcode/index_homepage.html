                        <p>When we drink water, our cells and mucous membranes are revitalized. In this way, hydration happens from the inside out, which reduces dryness, skin peeling and the appearance of pimples. To make this result even better, it is advisable to wash the skin with cold water and avoid contact with products, liquids and hot surfaces as much as possible.</p>

                        <p>The sweat we release during exercise or on very hot days is actually our body regulating its internal temperature. If it is not replaced, consequences such as dehydration, fainting and even pressure drop can occur. Having a bottle of water with you at these times is a way to avoid more serious problems. </p>

                        <p>Consuming mineral water properly helps to clean the urinary tract. This advantage allows the fight against diseases such as urinary infections and kidney stones due to the various trips to the bathroom. It's also a great treatment for those who already suffer from chronic problems like these.</p>

                        <p>Water is an essential element for anyone dealing with gastrointestinal problems, as it helps to form and hydrate the stool...it helps (a lot!) when going to the bathroom.
                        Another important function that water has in the digestive system is to decrease the feeling of bloating and gas. For those who suffer from this, it is indicated to drink 2 to 3 glasses of water before a meal. In addition to controlling appetite, water helps to "line" the stomach and avoid such bad feelings.</p>

                        <p>Mineral water is a great ally for anyone wanting to lose weight. That's because when we lose water, through sweat and other physiological functions, our kidney does not perform 100% of its functions and overloads our liver. As the liver is one of the organs that helps in burning fat, when it is overloaded by the lack of water it ends up not performing its main function. Therefore, ingesting the amount of water indicated for your age group can help you complement the diet.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>As it is directly related to blood density, recent studies point to a relationship between blood pressure control and large water consumption. Some devices that measure blood pressure do so based on the water content in the blood. This can be quite a complement for anyone who takes treatments for high blood pressure and in any case, it continues to be a healthy practice.</p>

                        <p>Your body temperature is regulated by perspiration, which stabilizes your body. However, drinking small amounts of water means you don't have sweat reserves to perform this function. Dehydrated people develop fever and chills within a few days, allowing their bodies to return to an ideal temperature. This sensation can persist for several days. Cold sweat, malaise and difficulty falling asleep.</p>

                        <p>Kidney stones are a known consequence of not drinking enough water. However, few people take this issue seriously. Initially, there is a urinary tract infection of strong color and smell, pain when urinating and pelvic discomfort, followed by toxic substances properly filtered by the kidneys and other harmful toxic components. In the body, these active ingredients build up over time, forming the so-called 'stones'. This stone can cause severe pain when it hardens. Often, they don't go away naturally and require surgery.</p>
